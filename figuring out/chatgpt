That sounds like a great approach! Starting with vocabulary will give you a solid foundation, making it easier to understand and construct sentences later. You might want to focus on essential words first, like common nouns, verbs, and everyday expressions. 

Since you already know Spanish, you’ll find many French words familiar, especially in academic or formal contexts. You could also practice pronunciation early on, as French has many silent letters and nasal sounds that are different from Spanish. 

Are you planning to use apps, books, or any specific method to learn?

That’s an awesome idea! An AI-powered assistant could make your learning experience much more interactive and personalized. You could integrate features like:
- **Vocabulary drills** with spaced repetition.
- **Pronunciation practice** using speech recognition.
- **Grammar tips** based on your progress.
- **Conversational practice** through AI-driven dialogues.
- **Real-time translations and explanations** of words and phrases.

Are you thinking of building it as a chatbot, a mobile app, or something else? Also, do you have a preferred tech stack in mind?

That’s a smart approach! Crafting a well-structured prompt will ensure the AI provides relevant and effective learning support. Since you're targeting people with a similar profile (Spanish native speakers with intermediate English starting to learn French), your prompt could include:

- **Learning Goals** (e.g., vocabulary acquisition, pronunciation, sentence building)
- **Preferred Learning Methods** (e.g., quizzes, flashcards, conversation practice)
- **Comparison with Spanish and English** (to highlight similarities and differences)
- **Progressive Difficulty** (starting simple and gradually increasing complexity)
- **Error Correction** (gentle feedback on mistakes)
